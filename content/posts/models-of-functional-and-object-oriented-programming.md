Functional Programming and Object-Oriented Programming remind me of two models of computation from computer science: Circuits and Turing Machines.

Object-Oriented Programming reminds me of a Turing Machine in the following way. The tape holds encapsulated data. The data is manipulated by the machine until it is in the form that you want it.

Functional Programming reminds me of a Circuit. Data is inputed and passed around from circuit to circuit instead of being stored somewhere. Each circuit, like a function, manipulates the data. The final form is returned at the end of the circuit.
