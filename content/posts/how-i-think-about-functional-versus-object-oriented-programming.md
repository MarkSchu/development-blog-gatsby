Here is how I think about the difference between **Functional Programming** and **Object-Oriented Programming**.

Object-Oriented Programming is characterized by making changes to state. There's a piece of data - the state - that is encapsulated in an object. The object has methods that manipulate the state. A computation is finished when the state is manipulated into the form that you want.

Functional Programming, on the other hand, is characterized by passing data around. There's a piece of data that is passed from function to function in a sequence of inputs and outputs. Each function manipulates the data in a particular way. A computation is finished when the data is manipulated into the form that you want.
