The most important principle that helps me avoid development churn is the principle of doing one small thing at a time. In other words, develop in incremental changes.

When you start to work on a feature, you notice other things that you'd like done. You notice styles that need updating, code that needs refactoring, and opportunities to add other features. The principle of doing one small thing at a time says to avoid these and focus on the one, small, well-defined task that you started with.

Whenever I feel like nothing is ever finished, there is a very good chance that I'm flouting this principle.
