ðŸ‘‹ Hey, my name is Mark Schumaker. I'm a frontend developer living in
Austin, TX.

Most of the code I write these days is in JavaScript.

I'm currently working on a blog called [Understand Hard Things](https://understandhardthings.com)
in which I learn and explain tricky topics. I'm building it with GatsbyJS, a static site framework that incorporates React and GraphQL. It is very much in progress. 

Here are some of the tools that I use:

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
* [Hapi](https://hapi.dev/)
* [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
* [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/)
* [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [git](https://git-scm.com/)
* Vanilla JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS

At the end of the day, I'm a coder and I feel like I can learn anything with documentation.
