ðŸ‘‹ Hey, my name is Mark Schumaker.

I'm a full stack developer living in Austin, TX.

Most of the code I write these days is in JavaScript and Python. Here are some of the tools that I use:

Node, Hapi, React, Redux, Mocha, Babel, ESLint, Webpack, GraphQL, Django, HTML, CSS, git, and npm.

At the end of the day, I'm a coder and can learn anything with documentation.

Feel free to reach out m.schumaker235@gmail.com
